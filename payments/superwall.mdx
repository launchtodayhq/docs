Superwall is a paywall optimization platform that helps you maximize subscription revenue through A/B testing, remote configuration, and analytics.

## What's Included

Launch includes a ready-to-use Superwall integration:

- **Superwall Provider** - Context for paywall state
- **Placement System** - Trigger paywalls at specific points
- **Remote Paywalls** - Design in dashboard, no code changes
- **A/B Testing** - Test different paywall variants

## How It Works

```
Your App                  Superwall                 App Store
─────────                ──────────                ─────────
  Calls Placement  ──▶    Shows Paywall     ──▶    Handles Purchase
                          (from dashboard)          via StoreKit
```

Unlike RevenueCat where you fetch products and build a paywall, Superwall handles everything:

1. **Your App** - Calls a placement (e.g., "upgrade_tapped")
2. **Superwall** - Shows the paywall configured for that placement
3. **App Store** - Handles the actual purchase via StoreKit

## Usage

### Show Paywall

The template includes a demo in the Payments screen. Tapping "Superwall" presents the paywall immediately.

```tsx
import { usePlacement } from "expo-superwall";

function MyComponent() {
  const { registerPlacement } = usePlacement({
    onDismiss: () => console.log("Paywall dismissed"),
  });

  const showPaywall = () => {
    registerPlacement({
      placement: "campaign_trigger",
      feature: () => {
        // Called if user has access (already subscribed)
      },
    });
  };

  return <Button onPress={showPaywall} title="Upgrade" />;
}
```

### Placements

Placements are events in your app where you want to show a paywall:

- `campaign_trigger` - Generic trigger for testing
- `feature_locked` - When user tries to access a premium feature
- `onboarding_complete` - After user finishes onboarding

In the Superwall dashboard, you link Campaigns to Placements.

## File Structure

```
apps/mobile/lib/payments/
├── config.ts              # API keys and env helpers
├── superwall/
│   ├── provider.tsx       # SuperwallPaymentProvider context
│   └── index.ts           # Exports
└── types.ts               # Shared types

apps/mobile/app/payments/
└── superwall.tsx          # Paywall screen
```

## Test Checklist

- Paywall appears from the placement
- Prices display correctly (not NaN)
- Sandbox purchase succeeds
