# Stripe Integration

Stripe is the payment provider used for direct billing in Launch. It handles
one-time purchases, subscriptions, and customer management, while the app and
API coordinate paywalls, checkout, and entitlement updates.

Launch includes a production-ready Stripe integration with a paywall screen,
webhook handling, and subscription management. This gives you a full billing
flow without wiring everything from scratch.
