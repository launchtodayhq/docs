## Which should I use?

| Integration    | Best For                   | Complexity | App Store Fees |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| **Stripe**     | Web + Mobile, Custom flows | Medium     | You handle     |
| **RevenueCat** | Subscription apps          | Low        | Handled        |
| **Superwall**  | Optimizing conversions     | Low        | Handled        |
| **Paddle**     | Global sales, B2B          | Medium     | Handled        |

<Note>
  For most mobile apps, we recommend starting with **Stripe** for maximum
  flexibility, then adding **RevenueCat** or **Superwall** if you need advanced
  subscription management or A/B testing.
