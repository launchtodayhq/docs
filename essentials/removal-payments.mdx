description: "Disable or delete payments (Stripe, RevenueCat, Superwall)"
---

## Prerequisites

- Payments feature flagged
- Access to mobile + API code

## Steps

## Disable (quick)

1. Toggle in `apps/mobile/features/feature-registry.tsx`:
   - `payments: false`
2. Hide UI entry points (tiles/buttons):
   - `apps/mobile/app/(tabs)/features/index.tsx`
3. Guard routes with `FeatureGuard` if needed.

## Delete (production)

### Mobile

- Remove payments routes:
  - `apps/mobile/app/payments/*`
- Remove payments provider and helpers:
  - `apps/mobile/lib/payments/*`
- Remove SDKs from `apps/mobile/package.json`.

### API

- Remove Stripe router and webhooks:
  - `apps/api/src/routers/stripe.ts`
  - `apps/api/src/routes/stripe-webhooks.ts`
- Remove any subscription logic if unused:
  - `apps/api/src/services/subscription.ts`
- Remove Stripe env vars:
  - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`

## Verify

- No payments screens are reachable
- No Stripe endpoints are mounted
- No Stripe env vars are required at boot

## Troubleshooting

- **Paywall still reachable**: remove entry points and routes
- **Stripe endpoints still active**: remove router wiring
