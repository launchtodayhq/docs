This guide walks you through setting up RevenueCat from scratch.

<Note>
  **First run tip:** If you haven’t configured products yet, disable the payments
  feature to avoid “offerings empty” errors:
  `apps/mobile/features/feature-registry.tsx` → `featureFlags.payments = false`.
  Re-enable after setup is complete.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

- Apple Developer account ($99/year)
- App created in App Store Connect
- RevenueCat account (free tier available)

---

## Step 1: App Store Connect

### 1.1 Create Subscription Products

1. Go to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com)
2. Select your app → **Monetization** → **Subscriptions**
3. Create a **Subscription Group** (e.g., "Premium")
4. Add your subscription products

### 1.2 Product Configuration

For each product, configure:

| Field          | Example                     |
| -------------- | --------------------------- |
| Product ID     | `mobile_launch_monthly_sub` |
| Reference Name | "Monthly Subscription"      |
| Duration       | 1 Month                     |
| Price          | Select a price tier         |

### 1.3 Add Localization

**Required!** Each product needs at least one localization:

1. Click on your product
2. Go to **Localizations** → **Add**
3. Add **Display Name** and **Description**

<Warning>Products without localization won't load in your app!</Warning>

### 1.4 Accept Paid Apps Agreement

1. Go to **Agreements, Tax, and Banking**
2. Accept the **Paid Apps Agreement**
3. Complete all required tax and banking information

<Note>Products won't load until this agreement is active.</Note>

## Step 2: RevenueCat Dashboard

### 2.1 Create Project

1. Sign up at [RevenueCat](https://app.revenuecat.com)
2. Create a new project
3. Add your iOS app with the correct bundle ID

### 2.2 Connect App Store

1. Go to **Apps & providers** → Your iOS app
2. Add your **App Store Connect Shared Secret**:
   - In App Store Connect: Your App → General → App-Specific Shared Secret
   - Click "Generate" if you don't have one
   - Copy and paste into RevenueCat

### 2.3 Import Products

1. Go to **Product Catalog** → **Products**
2. Click **+ New** under your App Store app
3. Enter the Product ID exactly as in App Store Connect
4. Products should sync automatically

### 2.4 Create Entitlements

Entitlements define what features users get access to:

1. Go to **Product Catalog** → **Entitlements**
2. Click **+ New**
3. Create an entitlement (e.g., `pro` or `premium`)
4. Attach your products to this entitlement

### 2.5 Create Offerings

Offerings group products for display in your paywall:

1. Go to **Product Catalog** → **Offerings**
2. Click **+ New**
3. Name it (e.g., `default`)
4. Add packages:
   - `$rc_monthly` → your monthly product
   - `$rc_annual` → your yearly product
5. Click **Make Current** to set as default

### 2.6 Get API Keys

1. Go to **API Keys** in sidebar
2. Copy your **Public API Key**
   - iOS: starts with `appl_`
   - Android: starts with `goog_`

---

## Step 3: Configure Your App

### 3.1 Add API Keys

Update `lib/payments/config.ts`:

```typescript
export const REVENUECAT_CONFIG = {
  iosApiKey: "appl_your_api_key_here",
  androidApiKey: "goog_your_api_key_here",
};
```

### 3.2 Set Payment Provider

```typescript
export const PAYMENT_PROVIDER: PaymentProvider = "revenuecat";
```

---

## Step 4: Create a Paywall

RevenueCat lets you design paywalls without code:

1. Go to **Paywalls** in RevenueCat dashboard
2. Click **+ New Paywall**
3. Use the visual builder to design your paywall
4. Add your products, benefits, and styling
5. Assign the paywall to your offering

The `<RevenueCatUI.Paywall />` component will automatically display this paywall.

---

## Step 5: Testing

### Create Sandbox Tester

1. App Store Connect → **Users and Access** → **Sandbox**
2. Click **+** to add a new tester
3. Use a unique email (can be fake, e.g., `test@example.com`)

### Sign In on Device

1. On your iPhone: **Settings** → **App Store**
2. Scroll down to **Sandbox Account**
3. Sign in with your sandbox tester credentials

### Test a Purchase

1. Build your app to your physical device
2. Navigate to the paywall
3. Complete a purchase using sandbox account
4. Verify in RevenueCat dashboard → **Customers**

<Note>Sandbox purchases are free and can be repeated for testing.</Note>
