## Platform Architecture

Launch uses a monorepo structure with three core applications that share type definitions and work together seamlessly.

## Current Implementation Status

The platform includes several key features that are ready for development:

**Authentication System**

- Better Auth integration with Expo plugin for seamless mobile authentication
- Apple Sign-In with social provider configuration and OAuth flow handling
- Session persistence using Expo SecureStore for native security on device
- Protected route guards with Expo Router Stack.Protected for declarative auth flows
- Deep linking support with custom `launch://` scheme for OAuth callbacks
- Instant authentication state transitions without navigation animations
- Custom fetch implementation with device headers for API authentication

**Type-Safe API Communication**

- tRPC server running on Koa.js with automatic type generation across platforms
- Custom fetch middleware injecting device information headers (platform, version, model)
- Comprehensive request/response logging with device metadata and performance tracking
- Error handling with structured validation using Zod schemas
- CORS configuration for secure cross-platform development environment

**Backend Architecture**

- Koa.js server framework with modular middleware architecture
- Better Auth handler mounted at `/api/auth` with Expo integration plugin
- tRPC router mounted at `/trpc` for type-safe API endpoint definitions
- Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL database integration and migration management
- Docker containerization with docker-compose for consistent development environment
- Environment-based configuration supporting staging and production deployments
- Structured logging with request tracing and device information capture

**UI Design System**

- HeroUI Native components for mobile with custom theming and pastel color schemes
- HeroUI React components for web applications with consistent design tokens
- Custom pastel theme system with dark/light mode variants
- Cross-platform styling with NativeWind for React Native and Tailwind CSS for web
- Consistent spacing, typography, and color systems across all platforms

**Development Infrastructure**

- Turborepo monorepo with workspace management and efficient build caching
- Hot reload across all platforms during development with instant feedback
- Comprehensive TypeScript configuration with strict mode and shared type definitions
- Automated database migrations with Prisma CLI integration
- Device information collection system for debugging and user analytics
- Docker containerization for API deployment with multi-stage builds
