    variables. [View Setup Guide →](/payments/stripe-setup)
  </Step>

- Webhooks hit `/webhooks/stripe` and update DB

## Troubleshooting

Start with [Stripe Setup](/payments/stripe-setup) and
[Stripe Webhooks](/payments/stripe-webhooks).

## Remove / Disable

To disable Stripe while you configure providers, set:

`apps/mobile/features/feature-registry.tsx` → `featureFlags.payments = false`

For production removal guidance, see [Removing Features](/essentials/removing-features).

## File Structure

```
apps/api/
├── src/routers/stripe.ts          # tRPC endpoints
├── src/routes/stripe-webhooks.ts  # Webhook handling
└── src/lib/stripe.ts              # Stripe client

apps/mobile/
└── app/payments/stripe.tsx        # Paywall screen
```

## Customizing the Paywall

The paywall is fully customizable via the `PAYWALL_CONTENT` object:

```typescript
const PAYWALL_CONTENT = {
  titleStart: "Unlock ",
  titleHighlight: "Premium",
  titleEnd: " and get full access",

  planLabels: {
    yearly: { name: "Pro Yearly", badge: "Best value" },
    monthly: { name: "Pro Monthly", badge: null },
    lifetime: { name: "Pro Lifetime", badge: null },
  },

  benefits: [
    "Unlimited access to all features",
    "Cloud sync across all your devices",
    "Priority support when you need help",
  ],

  links: {
    terms: "https://yourapp.com/terms",
    privacy: "https://yourapp.com/privacy",
  },
};
```
