    nvm use 24
    node --version
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="pnpm">
    ```bash

    pnpm --version
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Mobile Runtime Options

- **Development build (recommended)**: run via `pnpm ios` / `pnpm android`
- **iOS Simulator**: requires Xcode
- **Android Emulator**: requires Android Studio
- **Expo Go (limited)**: useful for quick UI checks only

If you are using a physical device, make sure it is on the same Wi‑Fi
network as your computer.

## Expo Go Limitations

Some native SDKs do not work in Expo Go. You will need a physical device and a
development build for:

- RevenueCat
- Push notifications
- Other native SDKs with custom config plugins

## Store Accounts (for release)

- **Apple App Store Connect** requires a paid Apple Developer account.
- **Google Play Console** requires a paid developer account.

## Troubleshooting

- **Node version mismatch**: run `nvm use`
- **pnpm not found**: reinstall with `npm install -g pnpm`

## Next Steps

Continue to [Start the Backend](/quickstart) to boot the API and database.
