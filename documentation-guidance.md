# Documentation guidance (Google-aligned)

These notes summarize Google Developer Documentation best practices for use as
our assessment rubric during the docs audit.

## Core principles

- Keep docs minimal, accurate, and current; remove outdated or redundant content.
- Write for humans first; prioritize clarity over completeness.
- Use a user-first voice: "you," active voice, conditions before instructions.
- Favor task-oriented structure: quickest success path first, then details.
- Make pages scannable: short paragraphs, meaningful headings, numbered steps.
- Consistency beats cleverness; internal consistency matters most.
- Update docs with code changes to prevent drift.
- Delete dead docs when unsure of correctness.
