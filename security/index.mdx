## Security Principles

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Never trust client input">
    Always validate and sanitize all data coming from the client, even if it
    seems to come from your own app.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Principle of least privilege">
    Only request permissions you need. Only expose data the user should access.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Defense in depth">
    Multiple layers of security. If one fails, others still protect.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Keep secrets secret">
    Never commit secrets to git. Use environment variables and secret managers.
  </Accordion>
