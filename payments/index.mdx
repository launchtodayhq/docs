## Which should I use?

| Integration    | Best For                   | Complexity | App Store Fees |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| **Stripe**     | Web + Mobile, Custom flows | Medium     | You handle     |
| **RevenueCat** | Subscription apps          | Low        | Handled        |
| **Superwall**  | Optimizing conversions     | Low        | Handled        |
| **Paddle**     | Global sales, B2B          | Medium     | Handled        |

<Note>
  For most mobile apps, we recommend starting with **Stripe** for maximum
  flexibility, then adding **RevenueCat** or **Superwall** if you need advanced
  subscription management or A/B testing.
</Note>

## Steps

1. Choose a provider:
   - [Stripe](/payments/stripe)
   - [RevenueCat](/payments/revenuecat)
   - [Superwall](/payments/superwall)
2. Follow the setup guide for your provider.
3. Ensure `featureFlags.payments = true` in
   `apps/mobile/features/feature-registry.tsx`.

## How It Works

Launch wraps payment providers behind a unified interface. The provider is
selected in `apps/mobile/lib/payments/config.ts`, and the UI reads from the
provider layer.

## Test Checklist

- Paywall screen renders
- Products/prices load from the provider
- Test purchase completes and updates entitlement state

## Troubleshooting

Use provider-specific troubleshooting:

- [RevenueCat Troubleshooting](/payments/revenuecat-troubleshooting)
- [Superwall Troubleshooting](/payments/superwall-troubleshooting)

For general issues, see [Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting).

## Remove / Disable

To disable payments while you configure providers, set:

`apps/mobile/features/feature-registry.tsx` → `featureFlags.payments = false`

For production removal guidance, see [Removing Features](/essentials/removing-features).
