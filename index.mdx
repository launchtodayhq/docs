## Build Apps That People Love

Launch is a production-ready starter kit for React Native and Expo. It's everything you need to build a real mobile app—not a tutorial project, but something you can actually ship to the App Store and Google Play.

One codebase. **iPhone**, **Android**, **iPad**, and **Android tablets**—all from the same code. Whether you're building a **fitness app**, a **marketplace**, a **social platform**, or a **SaaS mobile companion**—Launch gives you the foundation so you can focus on what makes your app unique.

  **Ready to dive in?** The [Quickstart](/quickstart) gets you from clone to
  running app in under 10 minutes.

## What You Can Build

Launch isn't opinionated about what you build—it just makes building faster. Here's what's ready out of the box:

### Authentication That Just Works

No more wrestling with OAuth flows. **Better Auth** powers the backend with Apple Sign-In, Google Sign-In, and email authentication fully configured. Sessions persist securely using Expo SecureStore, protected routes guard your screens, and users stay logged in across app restarts.

→ [Set up authentication](/authentication/backend-setup)

### Payments & Subscriptions

Monetize from day one. Integrate **Stripe** for one-time payments, **RevenueCat** for cross-platform subscriptions, or **Superwall** for dynamic paywalls. The backend handles webhooks, receipt validation, and subscription status—you just build the UI.

→ [Explore payment options](/payments)

### File Uploads That Scale

Upload profile photos, documents, or 4K videos—all securely stored in **AWS S3** with presigned URLs. Small files upload directly. Large files use S3 multipart uploads with resume support. Really large files? Native background uploads using iOS URLSession and Android coroutines that continue even when the app is backgrounded.

→ [Learn about file uploads](/file-uploads)

### AI-Powered Features

Add AI chat to your app with streaming responses. Connect to OpenAI, Anthropic, or other providers. Conversations persist, system prompts customize behavior, and the UI handles streaming gracefully.

## The Stack

Launch uses modern, battle-tested technologies that scale:

| Layer          | Technology          | Why                                          |
| -------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Mobile**     | React Native + Expo | iOS, Android, iPad, and Android tablets      |
| **Navigation** | Expo Router         | File-based routing, deep linking built-in    |
| **UI**         | HeroUI + NativeWind | Beautiful components, Tailwind-style styling |
| **API**        | tRPC                | End-to-end type safety, no code generation   |
| **Database**   | Prisma + PostgreSQL | Type-safe queries, easy migrations           |
| **Auth**       | Better Auth         | Modern auth with social providers            |
| **Monorepo**   | Turborepo           | Fast builds, shared code                     |

Everything is TypeScript. Types flow from your database schema to your mobile UI. Change a field in Prisma, and TypeScript catches everywhere that needs updating.

## Why Launch?

**Skip the boilerplate.** Authentication, payments, file uploads, API setup—these take weeks to build properly. Launch has them done.

**Production patterns.** This isn't demo code. It's the same architecture used in apps with real users. Security, error handling, and edge cases are handled.

**Stay in control.** No vendor lock-in, no magic. You own the code. Eject, modify, or extend anything.
