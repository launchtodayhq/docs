## Build and Ship Faster

Launch is a production-ready starter kit for React Native and Expo. It gives you a real app baseline with the systems you typically need before launch.

One codebase covers **iOS**, **Android**, **iPad**, and **Android tablets**. Use it for a consumer app, SaaS companion, or internal tool—then customize the product layer.

<Tip>
  **Start here:** The [Quickstart](/quickstart) gets you from clone to a running
  app quickly.

## What You Can Build

Launch isn't opinionated about the product. It provides the foundations so you can move faster:

### Authentication

**Better Auth** powers the backend with Apple Sign-In, Google Sign-In, and email OTP. Sessions persist securely via Expo SecureStore, and protected routes keep auth‑gated screens consistent.

→ [Set up authentication](/authentication/backend-setup) · [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/)

### Payments and Subscriptions

Integrate **Stripe** for one‑time payments, **RevenueCat** for subscriptions, or **Superwall** for paywalls. The backend handles webhooks, receipt validation, and subscription status.

→ [Explore payment options](/payments) · [Stripe](https://stripe.com/gb) · [RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com/) · [Superwall](https://superwall.com/)

### File Uploads

Upload photos, documents, or large media with **AWS S3** presigned URLs. Smaller files upload directly, larger files use multipart uploads, and native background uploads handle long‑running transfers.

→ [Learn about file uploads](/file-uploads) · [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)

### AI Features

Add AI chat with streaming responses. Connect to OpenAI or Anthropic, persist conversations, and customize prompts.

→ [Add AI features](/ai-features/overview)

### Push Notifications

Register devices, manage tokens, and send notifications across iOS and Android with FCM/APNS wiring already in place.

→ [Set up push notifications](/push-notifications) · [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) · [Apple APNs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/sending-notification-requests-to-apns)

### Onboarding and Theming

Ship a guided onboarding flow with phone OTP, and a light/dark theme system wired across the app.

## The Stack

Launch uses a modern, well‑maintained stack:

| Layer          | Technology          | Why                                          |
| -------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Mobile**     | React Native + Expo | iOS, Android, iPad, and Android tablets      |
| **Navigation** | Expo Router         | File-based routing, deep linking built-in    |
| **UI**         | HeroUI + NativeWind | Component library with Tailwind-style styling ([HeroUI Native](https://v3.heroui.com/docs/native/getting-started)) |
| **API**        | tRPC                | End-to-end type safety, no code generation   |
| **Database**   | Prisma + PostgreSQL | Type-safe queries, easy migrations           |
| **Auth**       | Better Auth         | Modern auth with social providers            |
| **Monorepo**   | Turborepo           | Fast builds, shared code                     |

Everything is TypeScript. Types flow from your database schema to your mobile UI. Change a field in Prisma, and TypeScript catches everywhere that needs updating.

### Integrations

Launch comes pre-configured with production-ready integrations:

- **AWS S3** — Secure file storage with presigned URLs → [File uploads](/file-uploads)
- **Better Auth** — Modern authentication with social providers → [Auth setup](/authentication/backend-setup)
- **Stripe** — Payments and subscriptions → [Stripe setup](/payments/stripe-setup)
- **RevenueCat** — Cross-platform in-app purchases → [RevenueCat setup](/payments/revenuecat-setup)
- **Superwall** — Dynamic paywalls and A/B testing → [Superwall setup](/payments/superwall-setup)
- **OpenAI / Anthropic** — AI chat with streaming → [AI features](/ai-features/overview)
- **Expo EAS** — Cloud builds and OTA updates → [EAS deployment](/deployment/mobile-eas)
- **Firebase (FCM)** — Push delivery for Android → [Push notifications](/push-notifications)
- **APNs** — Push delivery for iOS → [Push notifications](/push-notifications)

### Feature Registry (Start Here)

Before diving into integrations, Launch uses a **Feature Registry** to enable or
disable major modules (payments, AI, uploads) in one place. This keeps the app
stable while you configure providers and prevents noisy errors during first-run
setup.

→ [How the feature registry works](/mobile/feature-registry)

## Why Launch?

**Save weeks of setup.** Auth, payments, uploads, API scaffolding, and routing are already wired.

**Production defaults.** Security, error handling, and observability are built in.

**Stay in control.** No lock‑in. You own the code and can extend or remove anything.
