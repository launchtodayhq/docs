title: "Start the Backend"
description: "Start the API and database for Launch"

This guide focuses on getting the API and database running locally. You do not
need to configure integrations to boot the backend.

## Prerequisites

If you are new to the codebase, complete the
[Prerequisites](/getting-started/prerequisites) first.

## Steps

## 1. Fork & Install

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/launchtodayhq/launch.git
cd launch

# Install all dependencies
pnpm install
```

## 2. Set Up Database

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Docker (Recommended)">
    ```bash
    cd apps/api
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Local PostgreSQL">
    ```bash
    # macOS
    brew install postgresql
    brew services start postgresql

    # Create database
    createdb launch
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## 3. Configure Environment

```bash
cd apps/api
cp example.env .env
```

For quickstart, the example values are enough to boot the API. You can customize
them later if needed.

## 4. Run Migrations

```bash
cd apps/api
pnpm prisma generate
pnpm prisma migrate dev
```

## 5. Start the Backend

```bash
cd apps/api
pnpm dev
```

You should see:

```
🚀 Server running on http://localhost:3001
```

<Note>
  The mobile app needs the API and database running to work end-to-end. If the
  backend is not running, sign-in and data fetches will fail.
