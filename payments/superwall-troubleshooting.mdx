This page documents common Superwall issues and their solutions.

---

## Prices Showing as NaN

This means Superwall couldn't fetch product prices from StoreKit.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Product Status">
    Products must be "Ready to Submit" or "Approved" in App Store Connect. Use
    the debug script to check status: ```bash node scripts/debug-appstore.js ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Product IDs Match">
    Product IDs in Superwall dashboard must **exactly** match App Store Connect.
    Common mistakes: - Extra spaces - Wrong capitalization - Typos
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test on Physical Device">
    Simulator cannot fetch real products from StoreKit. Use a physical device
    with a sandbox account signed in.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for Apple">
    New products can take 15-30 minutes to propagate through Apple's systems.
    Check [Apple System Status](https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/) for
    outages.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  This is often an Apple StoreKit issue, not Superwall. If all settings are
  correct, waiting usually resolves it.
</Tip>

## PlacementNotFound

The placement name in your code doesn't match any active Campaign in Superwall.

### Solutions

1. **Check Campaign Status**

   Dashboard → Campaigns → Verify status is **Active** (not Draft)

2. **Verify Placement Name**

   The placement in your code must exactly match the Campaign:

   ```typescript
   // In your code
   registerPlacement({ placement: "campaign_trigger" });

   // Must match Campaign's placement in Superwall dashboard
   ```

3. **Restart App**

   After making changes in the dashboard, fully restart the app (not just reload).

## Old Paywall Showing

Superwall caches paywall assignments. To see a new paywall:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Archive Old Campaign">
    Dashboard → Campaigns → Archive the old campaign
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create New Campaign">
    Create a new Campaign with the new paywall
  </Step>

  <Step title="Restart App">Fully quit and restart the app</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Superwall uses "sticky" assignments - users see the same paywall variant
  consistently. Creating a new Campaign resets this.
</Note>

## Paywall Not Appearing

### Check SuperwallProvider

Ensure your component is wrapped with the provider:

```typescript
import { SuperwallProvider } from "expo-superwall";
import { SUPERWALL_CONFIG } from "@/lib/payments/config";

export default function Screen() {
  return (
    <SuperwallProvider
      apiKeys={{
        ios: SUPERWALL_CONFIG.iosApiKey,
        android: SUPERWALL_CONFIG.androidApiKey,
      }}
    >
      <Content />
    </SuperwallProvider>
  );
}
```

### Check API Key

Verify the API key is correct and starts with `pk_`.

### Check Campaign Status

Dashboard → Campaigns → Must be **Active**

### Check Console Logs

Look for errors in the console when triggering the placement.

## "Cannot connect to iTunes Store"

This is an Apple/StoreKit error, not Superwall.

1. Check internet connection
2. Try a different sandbox account
3. Wait a few minutes and retry
4. Check [Apple System Status](https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/)

---

## Simulator Testing

**Simulators cannot connect to App Store Connect.**

Options:

1. **Use Physical Device** (recommended)

   - Sign into sandbox account in Settings → App Store

2. **Use StoreKit Configuration File**
   - Xcode → File → New → StoreKit Configuration File
   - Add products with matching IDs
   - Edit Scheme → Run → Options → StoreKit Configuration

---

## Multiple Navigations Back

If closing the paywall navigates back multiple screens:

This happens when multiple callbacks fire. The template includes a guard:

```typescript
const hasNavigatedBack = useRef(false);

const goBack = useCallback(() => {
  if (!hasNavigatedBack.current) {
    hasNavigatedBack.current = true;
    router.back();
  }
}, [router]);
```

Ensure your paywall screen uses this pattern.

## Superwall vs RevenueCat

| Feature                 | Superwall             | RevenueCat         |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ |
| Paywall A/B Testing     | ✅ Built-in           | ❌ Manual          |
| Remote Paywall Updates  | ✅ Yes                | ✅ Yes (Paywalls)  |
| Subscription Management | ❌ No                 | ✅ Yes             |
| Cross-Platform Sync     | ❌ No                 | ✅ Yes             |
| Analytics               | ✅ Conversion focused | ✅ Revenue focused |

**Use Superwall if**: You want to optimize paywall conversion with A/B testing

**Use RevenueCat if**: You need cross-platform subscription management

**Use Both**: Some apps use Superwall for paywalls and RevenueCat for subscription management
