## Why this is core

Launch uses Better Auth for sessions and user identity. This layer is woven into
routing, device tracking, and data access. Removing it would require a full
re-architecture, so it is **not** supported as a feature deletion.

## Prerequisites

- You want to keep core sessions
- You only need to disable providers

## Steps

1. Remove provider UI entry points
2. Remove provider env vars
3. Restart the API

## What you can disable

You can still remove **providers** and entry points:

- Apple Sign-In
- Google Sign-In
- Email OTP flows

## Disable Apple / Google

1. Remove provider UI buttons:
   - `apps/mobile/app/auth/*`
2. Remove env vars from the API:
   - `APPLE_*` and `GOOGLE_*`
3. Restart the API server to pick up env changes.

Better Auth only registers providers when the env vars are present, so removing
them disables the provider.

## Disable Email OTP

1. Remove Email Sign-In entry points and screens:
   - `apps/mobile/app/auth/email-signin.tsx`
2. Remove email-specific UI hooks if unused.
3. Remove `RESEND_API_KEY` from the API.

## What not to remove

- Session cookies and auth middleware
- Auth-related tRPC procedures used by the app

If you need a fully unauthenticated product, treat it as a new product baseline
and plan a custom refactor instead of “removing auth.”

## Troubleshooting

- **Provider still shows**: check auth screen entry points
- **Sign‑in still enabled**: verify env vars are removed
