## Prerequisites

- API running locally or deployed
- `BETTER_AUTH_URL` and `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` aligned

## Steps

1. Identify the failing provider (Apple, Google, or Email OTP)
2. Confirm the API is reachable from the device
3. Check API logs for the request
4. Verify env vars and callback URLs

## Troubleshooting

- **OAuth state mismatch**: ensure API and mobile use the same base URL. Mixing
  `http://192.168.x.x:3001` on mobile with an ngrok URL on the API will fail.
- **Invalid client**: confirm `GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID` (backend) and
  `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID` / `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID`
  (mobile) match the credentials you created.
- **Provider not found**: the API only enables Google or Apple if the required
  env vars are present. Double-check `GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID`,
  `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and the Apple env values, then restart the API.
- **Callback 404**: check `/api/auth/callback/*` routes are reachable and that
  `BETTER_AUTH_URL` is set to the same origin used by the device.
- **Session not persisting**: confirm you are using a development build (not
  Expo Go) and that SecureStore is available on the device.
- **Email OTP not sending**: verify `RESEND_API_KEY` and that your sender domain
  is verified in Resend for production.

## Need help?

If you run into any auth issues you cannot resolve, email
`support@launchtoday.dev` with:

- Which provider failed (Apple, Google, Email OTP)
- The exact error message or screenshot
- Whether you are testing locally or on a deployed API
- The device and platform (iOS simulator, Android device, etc.)
