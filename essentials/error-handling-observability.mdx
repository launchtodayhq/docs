description: "How to ship with confidence: safe logging, correlation IDs, and Sentry/Datadog-ready patterns"

## Goal

In production, the fastest teams aren’t the ones who never ship bugs—they’re the ones who can **detect**, **triage**, and **fix** issues quickly.

Launch aims to teach a high-quality baseline:

- errors have consistent shapes/codes
- logs don’t leak secrets/PII
- every incident can be traced across mobile ↔ API ↔ database

## What to implement (recommended baseline)

### 1) Correlation IDs

Every API request should have a stable identifier (`requestId` / `traceId`) that appears in:

- API logs
- API error responses
- client error reports (Sentry breadcrumbs)

This is the foundation of debugging “what happened to this user” in Datadog/Sentry.

### 2) Safe logging

Rules:

- never log auth cookies, tokens, idTokens, refresh tokens
- sanitize request bodies and headers before logging
- log structured data (JSON) so Datadog can index fields

### 3) Consistent error taxonomy

Keep a small set of stable error codes and handle them explicitly:

- `UNAUTHORIZED`, `FORBIDDEN`
- `VALIDATION_ERROR`
- `RATE_LIMITED`
- `UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT`, `UPSTREAM_ERROR`
- `INTERNAL_ERROR`

Client UI should branch on codes, not string matching.

### 4) Mobile UX patterns

- a global error boundary for unexpected crashes
- friendly error messages with retry actions for network failures
- treat cancellations (e.g. aborting streaming) as non-errors

## Sentry / Datadog guidance (high-level)

### Mobile

Recommended:

- Sentry for JS + native crash reporting
- optional Datadog RUM for performance + network tracing

Attach:

- app version, platform, device type
- user ID (if your privacy policy allows)

Do **not** attach:

- cookies, tokens, authorization headers

### API

Recommended:

- structured logs (Datadog log ingestion)
- APM/tracing (Datadog APM or OpenTelemetry)
- optional Sentry Node for exception + performance traces

## Production checklist

- rate limit auth + expensive endpoints (like streaming)
- ensure error responses don’t leak internal stack traces
- ensure logs are sanitized
- confirm you can correlate a mobile error → API logs using a requestId/traceId
