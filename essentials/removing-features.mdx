## The rule of thumb

Use the feature registry to **explore and learn**, then **delete features you won’t ship**.

Disabling is great for the template experience, but deletion is cleaner for production apps.

## Disable vs delete

### Disable (template / exploration)

Best for:

- quickly trying features without setting up keys
- demo builds
- temporarily turning off sections during development

How:

- Toggle flags in `apps/mobile/features/feature-registry.tsx`
- Guard routes using `FeatureGuard` (already applied for Payments/AI/File Uploads)
- Hide entry points (tiles/buttons) based on `isFeatureEnabled(...)`

### Delete (production)

Best for:

- shipping a focused product
- reducing dependencies and risk
- simplifying upgrades, security review, and bundle size

## Removal checklist (use this for every feature)

### Mobile

- Remove entry points (tabs, tiles, buttons, deep links)
- Remove or guard all routes/screens for the feature
- Remove feature providers from `FeatureProviders`
- Remove feature-specific environment variables
- Remove unused dependencies from `apps/mobile/package.json`

### Backend

- Remove tRPC routers / REST endpoints that only exist for the feature
- Remove external integrations (Stripe/S3 keys, webhook routes, etc.)
- Remove database models/migrations if they’re truly feature-specific

## Example: removing Payments

1. Disable in `apps/mobile/features/feature-registry.tsx` (`payments: false`)
2. Remove UI entry points:
   - remove the Payments tile in `apps/mobile/app/(tabs)/features/index.tsx`
3. Delete the Payments route group:
   - `apps/mobile/app/payments/*`
4. Remove payments providers and SDKs from `apps/mobile/lib/payments/*` and deps
5. Remove backend Stripe endpoints if not used:
   - `apps/api/src/routers/stripe.ts`
   - `apps/api/src/routes/stripe-webhooks.ts` (and related webhook wiring)
6. Remove Stripe env vars from your deployment

## Example: removing AI

1. Disable `ai: false`
2. Remove `apps/mobile/app/ai-chat.tsx` and any entry points
3. Remove API streaming route if not used:
   - `apps/api/src/routes/ai-stream.ts`
4. Remove OpenAI/Anthropic env vars

## Example: removing File Uploads

1. Disable `fileUploads: false`
2. Remove `apps/mobile/app/file-uploads/*` and entry points
3. Remove upload module deps from mobile if not needed
4. Remove backend S3 router if not used:
   - `apps/api/src/routers/upload.ts`
   - `apps/api/src/lib/s3.ts`
5. Remove S3 env vars
