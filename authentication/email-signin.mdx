description: "Set up passwordless email authentication using one-time passwords (OTP)"
---

## Overview

Launch includes a complete email authentication system using one-time passwords (OTP). This provides a passwordless, secure sign-in experience that works seamlessly with the existing social authentication flows.

## Features

- **Passwordless Authentication**: Users sign in with just their email address
- **6-digit OTP Codes**: Secure verification codes sent via email
- **Auto-verification**: Automatically verifies when the 6th digit is entered
- **Resend Functionality**: 30-second countdown with resend capability
- **React Query Integration**: Optimistic loading states and error handling
- **Haptic Feedback**: Success and error vibrations on mobile devices
- **Dark Mode Support**: Fully themed for light and dark modes

## Backend Setup

### 1. Install Resend

The email system uses [Resend](https://resend.com/) for reliable email delivery:

```bash
cd apps/api
npm install resend
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Add your Resend API key to your environment variables:

```env
# apps/api/.env
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here
```

<Note>
  Get your API key from [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/api-keys) after
  creating an account.
</Note>

### 3. Verify Domain (Production)

For production use, verify your sending domain in Resend:

1. Go to [Resend Domains](https://resend.com/domains)
2. Add your domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)
3. Configure DNS records as provided
4. Update the `from` email in `apps/api/src/services/auth.ts`

```typescript
// apps/api/src/services/auth.ts
sendVerificationOTP: async ({ email, otp, type }) => {
  await resend.emails.send({
    from: "Launch <auth@yourdomain.com>", // Update this
    to: email,
    subject: "Your verification code",
    text: `Your verification code is: ${otp}`,
  });
};
```

## Authentication Flow

### 1. Email Input

Users enter their email address on the signup screen:

- **Validation**: Basic email format validation
- **Loading State**: Shows "Sending..." with disabled button
- **Error Handling**: Console logging (TODO: User-facing errors)

### 2. OTP Verification

Users receive a 6-digit code via email:

- **Auto-focus**: First input field focuses automatically
- **Auto-progression**: Moves to next field on digit entry
- **Auto-verification**: Submits when 6th digit is entered
- **Error Animation**: Red border shake on incorrect code
- **Success Feedback**: Haptic vibration and navigation

### 3. Resend Functionality

If code isn't received:

- **30-second Countdown**: Prevents spam with timer
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows countdown and loading states
- **Automatic Restart**: Timer restarts after successful resend

## Code Structure

### Mutations (React Query)

All email authentication logic is organized in domain-specific mutations:

```
📁 apps/mobile/lib/mutations/auth/
├── email-otp.ts              # OTP mutations
└── index.ts                  # Auth exports
```

**Available Mutations:**

- `useSendEmailOtpMutation` - Send OTP to email
- `useVerifyEmailOtpMutation` - Verify OTP code
- `useResendEmailOtpMutation` - Resend OTP code

### Usage Example

```typescript
import { useSendEmailOtpMutation } from "@/lib/mutations";

function SignUpScreen() {
  const sendEmailOtpMutation = useSendEmailOtpMutation();

  const handleEmailSignUp = () => {
    sendEmailOtpMutation.mutate(email);
  };

  return (
    <Button
      disabled={sendEmailOtpMutation.isPending}
      onPress={handleEmailSignUp}
    >
      {sendEmailOtpMutation.isPending ? "Sending..." : "Continue"}
    </Button>
  );
}
```

## UI Components

### OTP Input Component

Custom 6-digit input with advanced features:

```typescript
<OtpInput
  value={otp}
  onChangeText={setOtp}
  isLoading={verifyOtpMutation.isPending}
  isVerified={isVerified}
  onComplete={handleVerifyOtp}
/>
```

**Features:**

- Individual input fields with proper focus management
- Loading spinner in last field during verification
- Error state with red borders and shake animation
- Disabled state when verified
- One-step backspace deletion
- Theme-aware cursor colors

### Countdown Component

Reusable countdown hook for resend functionality:

```typescript
const countdown = useCountdown({
  initialSeconds: 30,
  autoStart: true,
  onComplete: () => console.log("Can resend now"),
});
```

## Navigation Flow

1. **Landing** (`/`) → **Sign Up** (`/signup`)
2. **Sign Up** → **Verify OTP** (`/verify-otp?email=user@example.com`)
3. **Verify OTP** → **Dashboard** (`/(tabs)`) via authentication guard

## Error Handling

### Current Implementation

- Console logging for debugging
- Haptic feedback for user awareness
- Visual error states (red borders, shake animations)

### TODO: User-Facing Errors

- Toast notifications for network errors
- Inline error messages for invalid codes
- Rate limiting feedback

## Testing

### Development Testing

- Uses test domain for immediate sending
- No domain verification required
- All email addresses work in development

### Production Considerations

- Verify sending domain
- Monitor email delivery rates
- Implement proper error tracking
- Consider rate limiting

## Security Features

- **OTP Expiration**: Codes expire after set time
- **Rate Limiting**: Built into Better Auth
- **Session Management**: Automatic session creation on success
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration

## Customization

### Email Templates

Modify the email template in `apps/api/src/services/auth.ts`:

```typescript
await resend.emails.send({
  from: "Your App <auth@yourdomain.com>",
  to: email,
  subject: "Welcome! Your verification code",
  html: `
    <h1>Welcome to Your App!</h1>
    <p>Your verification code is: <strong>${otp}</strong></p>
    <p>This code expires in 10 minutes.</p>
  `,
});
```

### Styling

All components use your app's design system:

- `@/constants/Colors.ts` for color definitions
- `@/components/app-text.tsx` for themed text
- Dark mode automatically supported

## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Received

1. Check spam/junk folders
2. Verify Resend API key is correct
3. Check domain verification status
4. Review console logs for errors

### OTP Not Working

1. Check code expiration time
2. Verify email matches exactly
3. Check network connectivity
4. Review backend logs

### Navigation Issues

1. Ensure authentication guard is properly configured
2. Check session state management
3. Verify route protection in `_layout.tsx`
