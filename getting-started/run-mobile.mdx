This guide assumes your backend is running locally.

## Prerequisites

- Backend running on `http://localhost:3001`
- `apps/mobile/.env` available

## Steps

## 1. Set the API URL

Create or edit `apps/mobile/.env`:

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL="http://localhost:3001"
```

If you are using a physical device, replace `localhost` with your machine's
LAN IP (for example `http://192.168.1.50:3001`).

## 2. Start Expo

```bash
cd apps/mobile
pnpm start
```

## 3. Open the App

- Press `i` for iOS Simulator
- Press `a` for Android Emulator
- Scan the QR code with Expo Go for a device

<Note>
  Some integrations (like RevenueCat and push notifications) require a physical
  device and a development build. Expo Go will not support them.
</Note>

## Success Check

You should see the Launch onboarding flow on first run.

## Troubleshooting

- **Can't reach the API from a device**: verify `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` uses your
  LAN IP and that your device is on the same network.
- **Metro errors**: restart with `pnpm start --clear`.
- **Changes not applied**: close the app and reload the Expo bundle.
