## Overview

Launch is designed for easy deployment to production. This section covers
deploying both your backend API and mobile app.

Most of the mobile workflow is handled by Expo (EAS Build + EAS Submit), so
deployment can be completed in a single afternoon once your backend is live.

| Platform           | Time   | Difficulty |
| ------------------ | ------ | ---------- |
| Railway (Backend)  | 10 min | Easy       |
| EAS Build (Mobile) | 15 min | Easy       |
| EAS Submit         | 20 min | Medium     |

<Note>
  **First time deploying?** Start with
  [Backend to Railway](/backend/railway-deployment) - it's the fastest way to
  get your API live.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

- **Env missing at runtime**: verify variables in your host (Railway/EAS)
- **Mobile can’t reach API**: confirm `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL`
