Use this checklist before you ship your app or hand the template to customers.

## Rename Launch placeholders

Search for “Launch” and “launch” in these files and replace them with your app
name, bundle IDs, and deep link scheme.

### Mobile app branding

- `apps/mobile/app.config.ts`
  - `name`, `slug`, and `scheme`
  - iOS `bundleIdentifier` and Android `package`
  - `CFBundleURLSchemes` (deep link scheme)
  - Stripe `merchantIdentifier`
  - Sentry `project` and `organization`

### Stripe checkout URLs

- `apps/mobile/app/payments/stripe.tsx`
  - `successUrl` and `cancelUrl`
  - Stripe `merchantIdentifier`

### File uploads (keys + storage)

- `apps/mobile/app/file-uploads/s3.tsx`
  - Storage keys and upload queue keys (e.g., `@launch/...`)
  - Update to match your app namespace

### Backend docs + Docker database name

- `apps/api/README.md`
  - App name references (“Launch API”)
  - Example env var values
- `apps/api/docker-compose.yml`
  - `POSTGRES_DB`, container name, and healthcheck DB name

## Verify deep links

- Ensure all `launch://` URLs are updated to your scheme
- Update `MOBILE_APP_URL` in `apps/api/.env` to match

## Payments & legal links

- Replace Terms/Privacy links in `apps/mobile/app/payments/stripe.tsx`
- Confirm merchant identifiers and payment provider keys

## Final pass

- Run a global search for “launch”, “launchhq”, and “launchtoday”
- Update any remaining branding or example values
