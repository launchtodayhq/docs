Launch is a monorepo with a mobile app and an API. This page gives you just
enough context before setup.

## Prerequisites

- None (this is a context page)

## What You Are Running

- **Mobile app**: `apps/mobile` (Expo + React Native)
- **API**: `apps/api` (Koa + tRPC + Prisma + PostgreSQL)

You will run both during local development.

## How Navigation Works

The mobile app uses **Expo Router**. Screens are defined by files in
`apps/mobile/app/`. For example:

- `apps/mobile/app/onboarding/welcome.tsx`
- `apps/mobile/app/(tabs)/index.tsx`

## Feature Registry

Launch uses a **feature registry** to enable or disable optional modules
(payments, AI, uploads) while you configure providers.

**Location:** `apps/mobile/features/feature-registry.tsx`

If you see errors during setup, you can temporarily turn features off there.

## Expo Go Limitations

Some native integrations do not run in Expo Go. You will need a physical device
and a development build for:

- RevenueCat
- Push notifications
- Other native SDKs with custom config plugins

If you are not ready for a device yet, keep those feature flags disabled.
