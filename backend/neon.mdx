Use Neon when you want a managed Postgres database for Launch.

## Create a Neon database

1. Create a project in Neon.
2. Copy the **connection string** from the Neon dashboard.
3. Set it as `DATABASE_URL` in `apps/api/.env`:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host.neon.tech/db
```

## Apply migrations

After setting `DATABASE_URL`, run the same migration commands you use locally:

```bash
pnpm --filter api db:generate
pnpm --filter api db:migrate
pnpm --filter api db:push
```

## Run migrations safely

Be careful running migrations against production from your laptop.

Recommended safety practices:

- Run migrations from CI (GitHub Actions) instead of local machines.
- Apply migrations only after a successful deploy.
- Use a dedicated “migration” step with environment‑scoped credentials.
- Test migrations on a staging database first.

If you need more control, move to a CI workflow that runs migrations with
explicit approvals and environment protection rules.
