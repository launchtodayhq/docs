## Welcome

There are two ways to build API documentation:
[OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) and
[MDX components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration).
Launch uses an OpenAPI file that lives in this repo.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```
