This guide assumes your backend is running locally.

## Prerequisites

- Backend running on `http://localhost:3001`
- `apps/mobile/.env` available

## Steps

## 1. Copy the Example Environment File

```bash
cd apps/mobile
cp example.env .env
```

The example env already includes everything needed for a first run.

## 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd ../..
pnpm install
cd apps/mobile
```

If you already ran `pnpm install` during backend setup, you can skip this step.

## 3. Set App Identity

Before you prebuild, update the app identity in `apps/mobile/app.config.ts`:

- `name` (this is the display name users see after install)
- `slug` (the internal Expo identifier, usually kebab-case)
- `ios.bundleIdentifier` and `android.package` (your app IDs)

Example:

- `name`: `Finance App`
- `slug`: `finance-app`
- `ios.bundleIdentifier`: `com.company.financeapp`
- `android.package`: `com.company.financeapp`

## 4. Prebuild

Before prebuild, set your bundle ID in `apps/mobile/app.config.ts` (the file
ships with a placeholder). This should match your Apple/Google identifiers
before you generate native projects.

```bash
pnpm prebuild
```

You will be prompted to set your bundle ID during prebuild.
If you see a warning about uncommitted changes, it is safe to continue for this
step.

## 5. Run the App

```bash
pnpm ios
pnpm android
```

Choose either iOS or Android. You can run on a simulator or a physical device.
For iOS, a physical device on the same Wi‑Fi network is supported.
When you run these commands, you'll be prompted to pick a simulator or device.
If your device is on the same Wi‑Fi, you should see it in the list; otherwise
you'll see available simulators/emulators. If no simulators appear, set up your
platform tools first:

- iOS: install Xcode and the iOS Simulator
- Android: install Android Studio and create an emulator

<Note>
  Some integrations (like RevenueCat and push notifications) require a physical
  device and a development build. Expo Go will not support them.
</Note>

## Success Check

You should see the Launch onboarding flow on first run.
During build, a good sign is seeing logs like:

```
› Using --device <your-device-id>
› Signing and building iOS app with: Apple Development: <Your Name> (<TEAM_ID>)
› Planning build
```

If you're on iOS, you should see:

![App setup complete (iOS)](/images/app-setup-complete-ios.png)

If you're on Android, you should see:

![App setup complete (Android)](/images/app-setup-complete-android.png)

## Troubleshooting

- **Auth or notifications warnings**: safe to ignore during initial setup if
  those plugins are commented out in `apps/mobile/app.config.ts`. Enable them
  later when you reach the auth or push guides.
- **Bundle ID not available**: pick a unique `ios.bundleIdentifier` and
  `android.package` (e.g. `com.yourcompany.myapp`) and rerun prebuild.
- **Android package name invalid**: use only letters/numbers with dots
  separating segments, and make sure each segment starts with a letter (e.g.
  `com.company.financeapp`).
