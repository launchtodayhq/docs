## Overview

Launch ships with a lightweight onboarding flow focused on phone-based sign-in
and optional notification permissions.

## Current Flow

The onboarding routes live in `apps/mobile/app/onboarding/`:

- `welcome.tsx` - Entry screen and next-step routing
- `phone.tsx` - Collects phone number for OTP
- `verify-otp.tsx` - OTP verification screen
- `push-notifications.tsx` - Optional push permission step

## Flow Control

Onboarding routing is handled in:

- `apps/mobile/app/_layout.tsx`
- `apps/mobile/lib/hooks/useAppNavigation.ts`

## Extending Onboarding

To add steps:

1. Create a new file in `apps/mobile/app/onboarding/`.
2. Add routing logic in `useAppNavigation.ts` if the step should be required.
3. Link from the prior step using `router.push(...)`.
