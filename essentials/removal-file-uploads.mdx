title: "Remove File Uploads"
description: "Disable or delete file uploads (S3 + native uploader)"
---

## Prerequisites

- Uploads feature flagged
- Access to mobile + API code

## Steps

## Disable (quick)

1. Toggle in `apps/mobile/features/feature-registry.tsx`:
   - `fileUploads: false`
2. Remove or gate entry points:
   - `apps/mobile/app/(tabs)/features/index.tsx`

## Delete (production)

### Mobile

- Remove upload screens:
  - `apps/mobile/app/file-uploads/*`
- Remove upload helpers and native module usage:
  - `apps/mobile/lib/upload/*`
  - `apps/mobile/modules/*` (file uploader module)
- Remove upload-related SDKs from `apps/mobile/package.json` if unused.

### API

- Remove upload routers and S3 helpers:
  - `apps/api/src/routers/upload.ts`
  - `apps/api/src/lib/s3.ts`
- Remove S3 env vars:
  - `S3_BUCKET`, `S3_REGION`, `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

## Verify

- No upload screens are reachable
- No S3 endpoints are mounted
- No S3 env vars are required at boot

## Troubleshooting

- **Uploads still visible**: remove entry points and routes
- **S3 errors continue**: remove S3 env vars and restart
