## Why We Built Launch

Launch exists to remove the cost and time of rebuilding foundational features
like authentication, payments, security, and infrastructure. Every app needs the
same base, but most teams rebuild it from scratch—burning engineering hours and,
in the AI era, a lot of tokens. Launch ships those foundations as a clean,
modern baseline so you can focus on product work sooner.

## Who It Is For

- teams building a new React Native app and wanting a strong baseline
- founders shipping a first version without hiring an infrastructure team
- agencies delivering custom apps faster with a reusable foundation
- teams that want a real, editable codebase instead of a black‑box template

## What This Means For You

You get a working, production‑oriented app with authentication, payments,
uploads, push notifications, AI integration patterns, and a backend that is
already wired. For businesses, it is more cost‑effective to start from a
professional, unopinionated template and apply your own skin and product design
than to rebuild foundations again. You can keep what you need, remove what you
do not, and scale the product layer without fighting the scaffolding.
