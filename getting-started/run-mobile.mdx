This guide assumes your backend is running locally.

## Prerequisites

- Backend running on `http://localhost:3001`
- `apps/mobile/.env` available

## Steps

## 1. Copy the Example Environment File

```bash
cd apps/mobile
cp example.env .env
```

The example env already includes everything needed for a first run.

## 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd ../..
pnpm install
cd apps/mobile
```

If you already ran `pnpm install` during backend setup, you can skip this step.

## 3. Prebuild

```bash
pnpm prebuild
```

You will be prompted to set your bundle ID during prebuild.

## 4. Run the App

```bash
pnpm ios
pnpm android
```

Choose either iOS or Android. You can run on a simulator or a physical device.
For iOS, a physical device on the same Wi‑Fi network is supported.

<Note>
  Some integrations (like RevenueCat and push notifications) require a physical
  device and a development build. Expo Go will not support them.
</Note>

## Success Check

You should see the Launch onboarding flow on first run.
