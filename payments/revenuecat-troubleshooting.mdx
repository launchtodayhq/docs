## Products Not Loading

### "None of the products could be fetched from App Store Connect"

This is the most common error. Check these in order:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check if using Simulator">
    **Simulator cannot fetch products from App Store Connect.**
    
    Solution: Test on a physical device, or create a StoreKit Configuration file in Xcode.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Paid Apps Agreement">
    Go to App Store Connect → **Agreements, Tax, and Banking**
    
    - Status must be **Active** (not pending)
    - Complete all tax and banking info
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check Product Configuration">
    Each product in App Store Connect needs:
    
    - ✅ Price set
    - ✅ At least one localization (display name + description)
    - ✅ Subscription group assigned
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Bundle ID">
    Your app's bundle ID must exactly match App Store Connect.
    
    Check `app.config.ts`:
    ```typescript
    ios: {
      bundleIdentifier: "com.yourcompany.yourapp",
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Sign In to Sandbox Account">
    On your iPhone:
    1. Settings → App Store → scroll to Sandbox Account
    2. Sign in with a sandbox tester
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Wait for Apple StoreKit">
    Sometimes this is an **Apple-side issue** with StoreKit. If all the above checks pass:
    
    - Wait 15-30 minutes and try again
    - New products can take time to propagate through Apple's systems
    - Check [Apple System Status](https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/) for outages
    - If persistent, contact Apple Developer Support
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  This error is often caused by Apple's StoreKit systems, not your
  configuration. If you've verified all settings are correct, waiting is usually
  the best solution.
</Tip>

### "None of the products registered in RevenueCat could be fetched from the Play Store"

This is the Android version of “offerings empty.” Check these in order:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Feature disabled until configured">
    If you haven’t set up products yet, disable payments to avoid noisy logs:
    `apps/mobile/features/feature-registry.tsx` → `featureFlags.payments = false`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify package name">
    Your Android package name must match Play Console:
    `app.config.ts` → `android.package`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Products are active">
    In Play Console → **Monetize** → **Products**, ensure each product is
    Active and has pricing set.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use a signed build">
    Install a signed build (EAS or Play testing). Play Store products won’t
    load in a debug build.
  </Step>
  <Step title="App is in testing track">
    Upload a build to an internal/closed testing track and add your tester
    account. Play Billing products usually require a Play-hosted build.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration Warnings

### "RevenueCat already configured"

```
WARN  RevenueCat already configured, skipping...
```

**This is harmless.** It means `Purchases.configure()` was called more than once. Our provider handles this automatically.

### "Products are configured but aren't approved in App Store Connect"

```
Products status (READY_TO_SUBMIT) requires action in App Store Connect
```

**This is expected for development.** Products in "Ready to Submit" status work for:

- ✅ Sandbox testing (physical device)
- ❌ Simulator testing
- ❌ Production

Products become fully "Approved" after your first app submission.

---

## Entitlement Issues

### "User has no active entitlements" after purchase

1. **Check product → entitlement mapping**

   - RevenueCat → Product Catalog → Products
   - Verify product is attached to an entitlement

2. **Verify purchase completed**

   - RevenueCat → Customers → search for user
   - Check transaction history

3. **Refresh subscription status**
   ```typescript
   const { refresh } = useRevenueCat();
   await refresh();
   ```

### Subscription works in sandbox but not production

1. App must be approved and live on App Store
2. Products must be approved (not "Ready to Submit")
3. Paid Apps Agreement must be active
4. User must have a real (not sandbox) purchase

---

## Paywall Issues

### Paywall shows but no products displayed

1. **Check Offerings in RevenueCat**

   - Product Catalog → Offerings
   - Ensure packages are assigned
   - Verify offering is set as "Current"

2. **Check paywall assignment**
   - Paywalls → your paywall
   - Verify it's assigned to an offering

### Paywall not showing at all

1. **Check RevenueCat initialization**

   - Look for `✅ RevenueCat initialization complete!` in logs
   - Verify API key is correct

2. **Check for errors in logs**
   - Enable verbose logging in development
   - Look for `❌ Failed to fetch offerings`

---

## Testing Issues

### Can't test on Simulator

The iOS Simulator cannot connect to App Store Connect. Options:

1. **Use a physical device** (recommended)
2. **Create a StoreKit Configuration file**:
   - In Xcode: File → New → File → StoreKit Configuration File
   - Add products with matching IDs
   - Edit Scheme → Run → Options → StoreKit Configuration

### Sandbox purchases not working

1. **Sign out of production App Store**
   - Settings → App Store → sign out of your real Apple ID
2. **Sign into sandbox account**
   - Settings → App Store → Sandbox Account
3. **Use a fresh sandbox account**
   - App Store Connect → Users & Access → Sandbox → create new

### "Cannot connect to iTunes Store"

- Check internet connection
- Try a different sandbox account
- Wait a few minutes and retry (App Store Connect can have delays)

---

## API & Network Issues

### "Network request failed"

1. Check internet connection
2. Verify API key is correct
3. Check RevenueCat status page: [status.revenuecat.com](https://status.revenuecat.com)

### Customer info not updating

```typescript
// Force refresh from network
const { refresh } = useRevenueCat();
await refresh();
```

---

## Debug Logging

Enable verbose logging to see detailed RevenueCat activity:

```typescript
// In provider.tsx - already enabled in development
if (__DEV__) {
  Purchases.setLogLevel(LOG_LEVEL.VERBOSE);
}
```

Look for these log patterns:

| Log                                  | Meaning                      |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `✅ RevenueCat configured`           | SDK initialized successfully |
| `✅ Loaded X products`               | Products fetched from store  |
| `ℹ️ User has no active entitlements` | User hasn't purchased        |
| `❌ Failed to fetch offerings`       | Products couldn't be loaded  |
